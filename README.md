### The problem Lotry solves

Lotry solves the core problem of illiquid, one-time lottery tickets. In traditional lotteries, once you buy a ticket, you're locked in. There’s no exit, no market, no way to profit unless you win.

Lotry changes that by making tickets tradable tokens. This unlocks a whole new layer of participation:

Traders can speculate on hype before the draw

Players can hold for a chance to win

Referrers can earn by bringing in new users

It improves on existing lottery models by blending them with liquid token markets, giving users more ways to engage, profit, and have fun, whether they win or not.

### Challenges we ran into

1. While creating the Mini App, publishing the app using farcaster.json and signing the accountAssociation signer was a bit confusing! We spent some time researching it!

2. Chainlink VRF setup – the Chainlink VRF subscription dashboard wasn’t responding. It created a lot of confusion, whether to add the consumer address to the VRF subscription.

3. While setting up Uniswap V4, we faced an issue with transferring funds to the pool.
